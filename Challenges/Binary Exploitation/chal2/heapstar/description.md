couldnt find a tier where i can put 'Ahmed khalil' in . so decided to make my own 


options :

malloc
show with nulled allocation
free
idea : replace topchunk into large bin attaque 

# notes : 
- replacing with mp.max_tcache doesnt work : aktough pointer might be controllable , count cant 
- replacing with tcache_per_thread doesnt work : 0x600 isnt reachable from normal tcache 

# exploiation : 
- spray chunks (first chunk needs to setup fake top chunk) (1)
- replace top-chunk 
- allocate other chunks with new top-chunk 
    - with these chunks overwrite sizes of chunks sprayed in (1) example overwrite 0x600 with 0x1400 so when it splits in next allocation , the freed pointer will be in a previously alloocated chunk so we get leak 

- large bin attaque to overwrite max_tcache_size into arbitr allocation with tcache . 
- allocation to tls -> RCE using __tls_dtor_list . 
    

notes for heap : 
next chunk will be checked for free as well : which means prev_in_use(chunk_at_offset(nextchnuk+nextsize)) will be checked
