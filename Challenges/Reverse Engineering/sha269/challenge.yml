  I'm pretty sure you've heard about SHA-256, however have you ever heard about SHA-269?
  It's a promising new hashing algorithm that is supposed to be more secure than SHA-256.
  I don't know how it works, but I have a feeling that it is not as secure as they say.
  Let's see if you can break it, here's the hash of the flag:
