The player should make a user, and fuzz directories

there will be /db, /data, /users that are interesting

visiting /db will have an old db dump, this will let them know there is a user called "admin", and that there are user, editor, and admin roles.

the /users/uuid will be like "Invalid user role", it actually returns all user data including the password so it's important. 
the player needs to think of a privesc, go to /register, check the response it will print things like this

{ 
        'username': username,
        'email': email,
        'role': user,
        'uuid': uid
}

The player should now manually add the "role" in registration to see what happens, for example putting admin, that causes a "invalid role id" error, now putting a number : 0 -> admin role is blocked, 1 -> editor, 2 -> user

After becoming an editor the user can successfully visit /users/uuid, the idea is to leak the admin's uuid, but how? There is a collaboration functionnality, which makes you able to make articles with other people, the idea is to choose the admin as collaborator, then intercept any accept collaboration request and change it's id with your request to the admin, effectively accepting it (IDOR),

afterwords, the admin's uuid can be knows by checking the src code on the articles (hidden author uuid).

This will let us visit /users/uuid of admin and get his password to login

the /admin has some stats, and a user ban function which is vulnerable to SSTI by the username parmeter, but everyhing is left default with the template_string and jinja2 (didn't import subprocess or anything) so it should be a rabbit hole,

the user should visit /data (which is admin only), and find dbconnect.exe and secrets.zip, the zip file is encrypted, the user needs to simply strings the dbconnect.exe or open it in a text editor to pull a password, then use it to open the zip file and get the flag in secrets.zip/data.txt
